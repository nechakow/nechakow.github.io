        <h2 class="text-primary">About the Job
        </h2>

        <h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
        <p>At MARZ, I worked as a <span class="text-primary">Technology Intern</span>. My primary focus was on the Render Farm Metrics Visualizations project, a project that focuses on the collection and analysis of real-time and historical data of MARZ's render farm. I utilized technologies like Python and PostgreSQL to store data from the farm, and Grafana and JSONata to build clear and concise visualizations to represent the data.</p> 
        
        <h3 class="mb-0">Starting From Scratch</h3>
        <p>The project team consisted of only myself and my supervisor, a senior render wrangler at MARZ. There had been some work completed on the project prior to my arrival, but, for the most part, we were starting from scratch. As a team, the two of us designed the workflow and processes we would use to store data, build a database, and create visualizations. Once the foundations were laid, I worked mostly through self-direction. This included determining the logical next steps for the project, and creating and managing my own JIRA tasks.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-0">Major Contributions</h3>

        <p>My biggest contribution to the project was a process I built myself: a script to automate the collection, processing, and uploading of the data on the render farm to the database. This process continues to be used daily at MARZ.</p>

    <section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex align-items-center" id="W2Goals">
      <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="text-primary">Goals</h2>
        <p>Working at MARZ was a new, refreshing, and challenging experience for me. When I first started, I knew nothing about the VFX industry. Additionally, many of the technologies were completely new to me, and I had never created automated processes in a professional environment. As such, at the beginning of the semester, I identified 3 goals that would help me to track my progress and learnings throughout the term. </p>
        <ol>
          <h3 class="mb-0"><li>Develop and Apply a Thorough Understanding of the VFX industry</li></h3>
          <p>As previously mentioned, I had no knowledge about the VFX industry coming into my internship at MARZ. However, through targeted research and discussions with other developers, I came to gain a very good understanding of the industry. I learned about the pipeline process used by developers and artists, which helped me understand artists' needs, guiding me in the decisions I made when creating visualizations of render farm data. My gained knowledge allowed me to successfully create useful visualizations that gained positive feedback from key stakeholders. My newfound knowledge of the VFX industry will enable me to succeed in future jobs I may pursue at similar companies.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-0"><li>Become Proficient in Grafana, JSONata, and PostgreSQL</li></h3>
          <p>Creating data visualizations was a big part of my responsibilities during my internship. There were many working parts to this; storing and grabbing data from PostgreSQL, building queries using JSONata, and using Grafana to create visual representations of these data queries. Though there was a learning curve, by the end of my first month I was able to successfuly create multiple data visualizations on Grafana using JSONata queries with little to no help. I documented my progress, which will be used by future interns working on the project. Not only will my knowledge of these technologies provide useful for future endeavours, but I learned a lot from the learning process, and built upon my technical documentation skills.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-0"><li>Build Personal Leadership Skills</li></h3>
          <p>As discussed in my job description, much of the work I did at MARZ was self-directed. This was a daunting task, given that I was unfamiliar with the industry and technologies being used. However, thanks to the knowledge I had gained in my first month at MARZ, I was able to assign myself and complete the necessary work without the direction of my supervisor for the majority of my internship. I was able to provide suggestions to my supervisor about potential next steps and make important decisions about the direction of the project on my own. The leadership skills I developed were more about self-discipline and learning than about leading others. The ability to lead myself through large projects like this will prove useful in future professional and personal endeavours, whether it be doing project management for a bigger team or creating my own personal projects.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>My time at MARZ was certainly special, and I'm incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity. This internship allowed me to broaden my knowledge of different technologies, instilled strong leadership skills within me, and enabled me to build useful automation processes from scratch. MARZ has definitely set me up for success in all my future endeavours.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">About Work Term 1</h2>
        <p>During the F21 semester, I completed my first co-op term at <a href="https://evenica.com/">Evenica Corp.</a></p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="mb-0">Who Is Evenica?</h3>
        <p>Founded in 2014 and located in Burlington, ON, Evenica is a software vendor that develops e-commerce solutions for mid-sized to large enterprise clients.</p>
       
        <p>Evenica utilizes Microsoft Dynamics 365, and is a Microsoft Gold Partner "recognized as the longest tenured and most experience e-commerce partner in the Microsoft ecosystem".</p>

        <p>Where Evenica differs from other e-commerce solution companies is in their methodology. They provide a positive experience for clients with a personal approach to customer service, and deliver direct, quick, and unique e-commerce solutions for even the most complex e-commerce challenges.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="mb-0">About the Job</h3>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>At Evenica, I worked as a <span class="text-primary">Web Application Developer</span> in the Dynamics 365 team. My primary goal throughout the term was to build an e-commerce website for a client using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-ca/commerce/overview/">Dynamics 365 Commerce</a> (D365). My role in the project consisted of coding and styling modules for the site using React and D365, and uploading products to the site using the D365 Site Builder application</p> 
        
        <h4>What is Dynamics 365 Commerce?</h4>
        <p>Dynamics 365 Commerce is a mature framework that "enables the creation of digital experiences using built-in web authoring and development tools". D365 Commerce creates e-commerce websites through a Site Builder application, a web authoring toolset that allows users build templates, select themes, and select and configure modules without writing any code. D365 Commerce allows the creation of custom modules for the Site Builder through React development with the D365 Retail SDK, which includes the "code, code samples, templates, and tools that are required to extend or customize existing Commerce functionality".</p>

        <h4>Being Part of a Team</h4>
        <p>I worked in a team under the mentorship of two senior software engineers, alongside 2 co-op students. As we worked through this project with the Agile methodology, an integral part of my job was maintaining constant communication with the members of the team. Every day, our team would meet to give updates on our progress and help each other with any issues that anyone had encountered. To further highlight the importance of communication to the project, our team was regularly recieving feedback from the client about changes to be made to aspects like styling. It was incredibly important that our team communicated with each other about designating tasks from the feedback, and improvements we feel can be made to each others work.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="mb-0">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Working for Evenica was an extremely valuable opportunity. I'm so thankful to have worked for a company that values it's employees as much as they do. My experience working with my amazing supervisors and fellow co-op students has provided me with important skills and a solid foundation that will help me with my future in software development. I learned about e-commerce, Microsoft technologies, and what a positive profesional software development environment looks like. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything.</p>

        <br>
